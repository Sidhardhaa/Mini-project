Q1) What is the recommendation and how to apply the biofertilizers in rice crop?<br>
Broadcast 10 kg of soil based powdered BGA flakes at 10 DAT for the dry season crop. Maintain a thin film of water for multiplication.<br>
Raise azolla as a dual crop by inoculating 250 kg/ha 3 to 5 DAT and then incorporate during weeding for the wet season crop.<br>
Mix 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 10 packets (2000g/ha)of Phosphobacteria or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos inoculants<br>
with 25 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly in the main field before transplanting and Pseudomonas fluorescens<br>
(Pf 1) at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with 50 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly before transplanting.<br>
Q2)What precautions measures should be followed while using biofertilizers?<br>
Seeds should be kept moist. Avoid using fungicides or other chemicals. Inoculants should be kept in the shade away from direct sunlight.<br>
Treated seeds should be sown in moist soil.<br>
Q3) How much moisture content should be maintained during storage to prevent from attack of insect pests ?<br>
The moisture content should be less than 8 %.<br>
Q4) Whether rice hybrids are suitable for direct seeding?<br>
Hybrids are not recommended for direct seeding as it requires high seed rate. Seed cost being very high, cultivation of hybrids becomes<br>
uneconomical under direct seeded conditions.<br>
Q5) Can the harvested seed from hybrid rice crop be used again for planting next crop?<br>
No. Every season, farmers have to purchase the fresh F1 hybrid seed for growing the crop of hybrid rice. The high yielding potential of<br>
hybrids is expressed in first generation only. If the seed from hybrid crop is used again for replanting, there will be lot of variation<br>
in the crop due to segregation and yield is reduced drastically.<br>
Q6) What does rough rice mean ?<br>
Rough rice, is a rice that has been harvested and threshed but still has its hull and bran.<br>
Q7) What is the cooking quality of hybrids rice ?<br>
Cooked hybrid rice is slightly sticky, which has lower amylase content.<br>
Q8) What are the rabi crops which can be taken as intercrops with sugarcane?<br>
Wheat, coriander, linseed, lentil, pea can be taken as intercrops with sugarcane.<br>
Q9) Is it possible to produce own hybrid rice seed?<br>
In order to maintain high seed quality and purity and for realizing targetted yields, hybrid seed should be strictly produced under the<br>
 supervision of a seed production agency either in public or private sector. This being a highly technical and skill oriented enterprise,<br>
 it may not be proper to leave it entirely to the farmers themselves, since quality control and marketing are also involved.<br>
Q10) Whether silica is beneficial for rice crop? <br>
Silicon, is one of the most abundant element in the earth's crust. Because of its abundance in the biosphere, the deficiency of Si as a<br>
 micronutrient for plant growth occurs very rarely. <br>
Q11) What is the harvest index for rice?<br>
When 80% of the panicles turn straw colour, the crop is ready for harvest.  Even at this stage, the leaves of some of the varieties may<br>
 remain green. Confirm maturity by selecting the most mature tiller and dehusk a few grains. If the rice is clear and firm, it is in hard<br>
 dough stage.<br>
Q12)How can the maturity be hasten in order to escape from monsoon rains?<br>
Maturity may be hastened by 3-4 days by spraying 20% NaCl a week before harvest to escape from monsoon rains. <br>
Q13) Can I get the information regarding the varieties of blackgram suitable for rice fallow pulses?<br>
CO 4, ADT 2, ADT 3, ADT 4, ADT 5, TMV 1<br>
Q14) What is the optimum time of sowing for rice fallow pulses?<br>
Third week of January â€“Second week of February<br>
Q15)Under dual cropping of rice with greenmanure, at what stage should the green manures be incorporated? <br>
Incorporate the green manure when the growth attains 40cm height or at 30 days after sowing, whichever is earlier, using Cono-weeder. <br>
Q16) How to avoid root snapping while pulling out the seedling for transplanting?<br>
If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior to pulling out.<br>
For clayey soils where root snapping is a problem, 4kg of gypsum and 1kg of DAP/cent can be applied at 10 days after sowing.<br>
Q17)What is the optimum planting depth for better establishment of rice?<br>
Shallow planting (3 cm) ensures quick establishment and more tillers.<br>
Deeper planting (> 5cm) leads to delayed establishment and reduced tillers.<br>
