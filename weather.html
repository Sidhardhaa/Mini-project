<b>Weather condition:</b><br>

 minimum temperature ranged from 19.8 to 25.6°C. <br>
 <b>Contingency measure:</b><br>
 1)	Farmers are advised to take utmost care in the harvesting and threshing of <br>wheat, maize and pigeon pea. Take precaution for safe storage of the <br>harvested produce. Elephant foot yam: Sowing In the previous forecasted <br>period, there has been light rainfall at many places in the North Bihar <br>districts. This has brought enough moisture in the soil which may be utilized <br>for sowing of elephant foot yam. Application of 10-15 ton FYM, 40 kg <br>Nitrogen, 60kg Phosphorus and 80 kg Potash per hectare is advised during <br>land preparation. Gajendra variety is recommended for sowing in North <br>Bihar. Seed should be treated with Trichoderma viridi before sowing. Seed <br>rate@ 80 quintals/hectare is advised.<br>
2)	Vegetables: Intercultural operation is advised in summer vegetables such as<br> lady's finger, pumpkin, cucumber, sponge gourd, bottle gourd.<br>
3)	Lady's finger: Monitoring is advised for infestation of leaf hopper in okra. The <br>damage is caused due to sucking of sap by hoppers, which lead to curling <br>and crinkling of leaves. In case of heavy infestation the leaves turn brick red <br>and crumble. If hopper crosses ETL (5 hoppers/plant), spraying of <br>Imidacloprid @ 0.5ml/liter of water is advised under clear days.<br>
4)	Green gram/Black gram: Regular monitoring is advised in green gram and black <br>gram crops for infestation of borer insect pests.<br>
5)	Cucurbitaceous crop: Monitoring is advised in cucurbitaceous crops for infestation <br>of red pumpkin beetle. If population of red pumpkin beetle exceeds <br>economic threshold level, spraying of Dichlorvos76EC@1 ml/liter of water is <br>advised.
